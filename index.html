        <h1>Support Angie Lane</h1>
        <p>Our dear friend Angie was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. She will be undergoing
            six months of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, followed by surgery and radiation. She will need
            all of the love and support she can get during this time. Here's how you can help:
        </p>
  
        <h2>GoFundMe</h2>
        <p>Cancer care is expensive. We've set up a <a href="https://gofund.me/c61220b41">GoFundMe</a> to help reduce Angie's financial burden. 
            Public updates are posted to GoFundMe.
        </p>

        <h2>Instacart</h2>
        <p>While going through chemo, Angie will be on a limited diet. In the place of homemade food, she
            would appreciate <a href="https://instacart.launchgiftcards.com/?utm_campaign=launch&utm_source=instacart&utm_medium=gift_card_landing_page_us&utm_term=97488AB7-4450-4ac6-b81f-4ef15ae9ad81">Instacart giftcards</a> 
            so that she can have the packaged and prepared food she needs delivered to her home. Please use her
            personal email address when sending giftcards.
        </p>

        <h2>Lotsa Helping Hands</h2>
        <p>Angie's close friends and family are using Lotsa Helping Hands to organize care and share personal updates.
            You can request to join Angie's private care team <a href="https://my.lotsahelpinghands.com/request/angies-support-team/select-email">here</a>.
